<h2>Implicit and Explicit Bias in Optimization Algorithms</h2>
<p>In modern machine learning, successful models are often highly overparameterized, possessing more trainable parameters than training examples. This leads to multiple minimizers that tend to overfit training data and fare poorly with new examples. Surprisingly, when using simple algorithms like (stochastic) gradient descent, specific minimizers yielded have exceptional performance on new data. By selecting a particular training loss minimizer, the optimization algorithm introduces extra learning bias. These biases manifest in two distinct forms: explicit and implicit. Explicit biases are consciously integrated into the objective function to induce solutions with favorable generalization traits. Implicit biases, conversely, stem intrinsically from the optimization process properties, devoid of explicit instructions. Studying models shaped by this bias is pivotal for understanding both the triumphs and constraints of overparameterized models, potentially giving rise to innovative algorithms.
<br /> <br /> 
<b>Contributions</b>: A series of papers [1, 2, 3, 4] have underscored the correlation between flatter minima and enhanced generalization. In a recent departure, our work [5] introduces a novel paradigm by injecting noise into model parameters to encourage the exploration of wider minima. This exploration seeks to comprehend the explicit regularization effects induced by modest perturbations across a spectrum of machine learning models, encompassing both simple models and complex over-parametrized neural networks. Our investigation reveals how such perturbations, particularly in simple models, engender explicit regularization grounded in diverse norms such as l1-norm, group l1-norm, and nuclear norms.
Our earlier work [6] unlocks a compelling connection between the implicit and explicit biases inherent in optimization algorithms. This insight, attained through leveraging duality, not only expedites optimization in convex over-parametrized models but also unveils the implicit convergence of stochastic mirror descent to the minimum mirror map solution. In a recent study [7], our exploration strides into investigating the implicit bias of mirror gradient flow and mirror Langevin within the context of convex problems from an optimal control perspective. This is the first variational formulation of continuous time mirror descent and mirror langevin algorithm. The result is a revelation of mirror descent as a closed-loop solution for a specific optimal control scenario, with the Bellman value function forged from the Bregman divergence between the initial condition and the global minimizer of the objective function. This outcome [7] extends far beyond our prior findings [6]. This body of research uncovers the intricate interplay between biases, vital for optimized solutions across problem domains. <br /> <br /></p>

<h2>Generalization of SGD for Non-Convex Learning</h2>
<p>In machine learning theory, one important research challenge is to understand the behavior and effect of noise in the stochastic gradients on generalization performance while training a model in a non-convex landscape. The noise in the stochastic gradient can be beneficial in helping the optimizer to escape local minima and provide exploration in rugged landscapes, hence helping in achieving better generalization performance. However, the structure of noise depends on the model parameter, loss landscape, and model architecture, and are correlated. That makes it hard to study the effect of noise on generalization.
Recent strides [4, 5] have utilized Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) as proxies for SGD, enabling insights into the effect of noise and generalization in the non-convex landscape. The Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics is a commonly employed SDE for this purpose where the structure of the noise is Gaussian. However, it’s crucial to recognize that not all gradient noise adheres to Gaussian assumptions. A series of studies [6, 7] unveiled heavy-tailed noise behavior in constant step size SGD training of neural networks due to multiplicative gradient noise. <br /> <br /> 
<b>Contributions</b>: In our recent work [1], we’ve pioneered novel connections between tail behavior and the generalization characteristics of SGD. This was achieved by studying the algorithmic stability of a heavy-tailed SDE, which emulates the observed heavy-tailed behavior in SGD, as demonstrated in the context of a quadratic optimization problem. Notably, our work reveals a non-monotonic relation between the coefficient of heavy tail and generalization. This intriguing insight also aligns with prior empirical findings. Expanding upon this foundation, the extension to general loss functions, including non-convex ones, has been undertaken in [2]. In this extension, we develop Wasserstein stability bounds for heavy-tailed SDEs, which are subsequently converted into generalization bounds. Importantly, these results are underpinned by fundamental principles and do not necessitate intricate assumptions.
In the endeavor to bridge the void between Markov chain theory, and SGD theory, in a recent work, we utilize the stability result of Markov chains [3] to derive generalization Bounds for (Noisy) Stochastic Gradient Descent that also includes SDEs across a broad spectrum of loss functions, encompassing a subset of non-convex functions. This is the first work to utilize the perturbation theory of Markov chains in the analysis of the generalization properties of variants of SGD. <br /> <br /></p>

<h2>Learning in Neural-Networks via Gradient Descent</h2>
<p>Currently, we are focussing on examining how stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and gradient descent (GD) optimize overparametrized deep neural networks. While there has been progress in understanding feature learning in neural networks through SGD and GD over the past few years, it remains constrained by narrow and strong assumptions. Our aim is to delve into the feature learning processes within complex deep neural networks and foundation models during training with GD or SGD, aiming to achieve near-optimal information-theoretical guarantees for feature learning. Furthermore, we are  investigating the feature learning phenomena in generative models, exploring what kinds of score functions can be learned using gradient descent.</p>
